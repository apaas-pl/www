## Tom Sapletta, DevOps Engineer at Softreck

I will delve deeper into meta-data aPaaS and general purpose programming aPaaS and provide key points that help enterprises choose the right aPaaS.
Pre-integrated stack of technology that we call "platform" should have happened around the 2003-05 timeframe. 
Hence the PaaS solutions we know of today in my view are only a necessary condition and not sufficient to really help large enterprises with where they need to go.

## Pre-cloud era

In the pre-cloud era there were:
+ no platforms
+ only products
+ IT departments (in big enterprises) had different structue, with "enterprise architecture groups" that defined the platform for their enterprise. 
+ They hand-crafted a platform definition standard for their enterprise by combining various products like:
  + app servers
  + web servers
  + databases
  + middleware
  + integration servers
  + portal servers
  + workflow engines
  + ...

### Managing IT software infrastructure

That is the only way they could manage the IT software infrastructure of very large multi-country, multi-location enterprises. 
Every large enterprise had its own blueprint platforms and they did a lot of heavy lifting not directly connected to their business outcomes.

## Cloud era
This presents an opportunity to move away from large capital technology expenses and align technology costs directly with business growth




## What is the difference between iPaaS and aPaaS?


### Platform Usage, Lines of Business
+ Modeling driven process/app development
+ Fast, Iteratove, Visual, Colaborative

### Platform Covernance, Enterprise IT
+ 

### PLatform Engineering, PaaS Vendor


## Post-cloud era


+ all is streaming
zamiast zarządzać infrastrukturą, kreaować ją z inteligencją w odpowiedni spersonalizowany strumień danych i funkcjonalnośći zamiast sformatowanych iu zdefiniowanych struktur aplikacji i baz danych.
